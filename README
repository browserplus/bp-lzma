The BrowserPlus LZMA service.

Overview

LZMA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZMA) is a compression algorithm with
high compression rates (~55% the size of gzip and 65% the size of bzip in 
one trial http://gist.github.com/59923), at the cost of increased runtime
(7x slower than gzip, and almost 3x slower than bzip) and increased memory
requirements at compression time.  Decompressing LZMA is comparable to bzip
with slightly greater memory requirements.

Given these tradeoffs, this authors claim is that LZMA is a wonderful choice
for the web, especially for the uploading of user generated content.  

Often, users have relatively fast machines with loads of memory, coupled
swith a slow upstream connection.  Being able to use a little bit of extra
time in compression can effectively save time during upload, resulting in 
a faster/better user experience.

What's Here

The C++ implementation of a BrowserPlus service which exposes LZMA
compression to the browser.  This project is essentially an integration
of the easylzma project into BrowserPlus
